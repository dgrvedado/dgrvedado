- I designed a small **MVC Framework for PHP** and named it [rekutuPHP](https://github.com/dgrvedado/rekutuPHP), combining the Guarani words "rekutu" which means "again", and the language name "PHP"

- Other personal projects I have worked on are creating a Laravel/Fortify/Bootstrap Admin Panel environment. Creating an initial development environment, to expedite other more serious projects. [LaraMatrix](https://github.com/dgrvedado/LaraMatrix) and coming soon [LaraLTE](https://github.com/dgrvedado/LaraLTE)


My development environment is 100% GNU/Linux, I don't like Microsoft operating systems; even if this same platform is theirs...

___I like to work with any relational database design (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server).___ 

___I am very enthusiastic about Docker and every day that passes I am convinced that it is the only way of the future, although I do not deny the power of virtualization.___
